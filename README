ShipItSquirrel - A Twitter bot that watches for keywords and replies "Ship It!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is a simple example of how to connect to a single Twitter account
that one owns, for the purposes of updating, following, or whatever. In this
silly example, our Twitter bot watches the tweets of friends for keywords and
replies with "Ship It!" whenever there is a keyword match. 

The ShipItSquirrel pays homage to: (http://shipitsquirrel.github.com) which is
forever immortalized as the mascot of the web app deployment, namely that there
is never a perfect version 1.0, only continuous development and deployment. So,
like ShipItSquirrel says, just "Ship It!". 

================================================================================
NOTE: YOU MUST GET YOUR OWN TWITTER OAUTH TOKENS FROM TWITTER AND PLACE THEM IN
THE CREDS.PY FILE FOR AUTHENTICATION TO WORK; CREDS.PY CONTAINS DUMMY DATA
UNTIL YOU DO SO.
